## Ingredients

- 1 avocado
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1 clove garlic
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 2 Tbsp fresh lime juice
- 1/4 bunch fresh cilantro
- 1/4 cup water
- 1/2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 lb. ground turkey
- 2 Tbsp taco seasoning*
- 1 head romaine lettuce
- 1 cup frozen corn
- 1 15oz. can black beans
- 1 pint grape tomatoes
- 1 jalapeño (optional)
- 2 oz. shredded cheddar

## Instructions

1. Make the salad dressing first so the flavors have time to blend. Peel the avocado and remove the pit. Add the avocado to a food processor or blender along with the sour cream, garlic (minced), salt, lime juice, cilantro, and water. Purée until smooth. Refrigerate the dressing until ready to use.
2. cook the taco seasoned turkey. Add the olive oil to a large skillet and heat over medium. add the ground turkey and cook, breaking it into pieces as you stir. When it's about half-way cooked, add the taco seasoning and continue to stir and cook until the turkey is cooked through.
3. Thaw the frozen corn (I use the microwave). Wash and chop the romaine lettuce, rinse and drain the black beans, slice the grape tomatoes in half, slice the jalapeño, and shred the cheddar cheese.
4. To build the salad, lay a bed of the chopped lettuce in each bowl, top with beans, corn, tomatoes, cheese, seasoned turkey, and a few slices of jalapeño. Drizzle the creamy avocado dressing over top and enjoy!
