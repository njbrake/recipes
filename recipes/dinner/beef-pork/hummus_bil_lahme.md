## Ingredients

### Hummus

- 1 can chickpeas, 796 mL
- 2-3 tbsp chickpea water (from the can)
- 3 ice cubes
- 1 garlic clove
- 1/3 cup tahini
- 1/4 cup lemon juice
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp salt

### Pine Nuts

- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 3 tbsp pine nuts

### Steak

- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 lb top sirloin
- 1 tsp Arabic 7 spice (or ground allspice)
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 tsp salt

## Instructions

1. Heat a can of chickpeas on medium heat for 10 minutes. Strain the chickpeas, saving the water. For a smoother hummus, rub them between your palms and the skins will float to the top, then toss the skins.
2. In a blender, add warm chickpeas, chickpea water, and ice cubes. Blend well. Scrape the sides then add tahini, lemon juice, cumin, and salt. Blend again. Taste and adjust seasoning.
3. Spread the hummus out on a large platter, creating a well in the middle for the beef.
4. In a skillet on medium heat, sauté the pine nuts in olive oil for about 30 seconds or until golden. Set aside on a plate.
5. Trim steak of excess fat. Dice into small 1/2 inch cubes. Optionally freeze the steak for 30 minutes prior for easier dicing.
6. In the same skillet on high heat, add the olive oil and cubed top sirloin. Spread the pieces out evenly. Let any excess water evaporate and then toss with Arabic 7 spice (or allspice), black pepper, and salt. Spread evenly again and let it brown on the other side. This should only take about 4 minutes.
7. Transfer the cooked beef into the well in the hummus. Garnish with the pine nuts and their oil.
