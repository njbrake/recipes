## Ingredients

- 4 large zucchini (about 2 lbs.)*
- 1.5 Tbsp cooking oil, divided
- 1 lb. Italian ground sausage**
- 1 small yellow onion, diced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning
- 3/4 tsp salt, divided
- 1/2 tsp freshly cracked black pepper, divided
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- 3/4 cup marinara sauce
- 1/4 cup breadcrumbs
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Wash the zucchini well, trim off the top stem, then slice each one in half lengthwise. Use a spoon or a melon baller to remove the flesh from the center of the zucchini halves, leaving a 1/4-1/2 inch rim around each. Roughly chop the scooped out zucchini flesh into small pieces and set aside.
2. Place the scooped out zucchini halves on a parchment lined baking sheet. Brush the insides of the zucchini with 1/2 tablespoon of oil and season with 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper. Pre-bake the zucchini in the oven for 15 minutes. After 15 remove the zucchini from the oven and set aside.
3. While the zucchini is baking, make the filling. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add 1 Tbsp of oil. Brown the Italian sausage.
4. add the diced onion and minced garlic to the skillet. Continue to sauté over medium heat until the onion is translucent and the garlic is fragrant.
5. Next add the Italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper, garlic powder, marinara sauce, breadcrumbs, and half of the reserved & chopped zucchini flesh***. Stir to combine. Simmer the mixture over medium-low heat for 5 minutes.
6. Next stuff the scooped out zucchini boats with the sausage mixture. Top with the shredded mozzarella cheese. Place the zucchini boats back in the oven and back for 15 minutes until the cheese is melted and the sausage mixture is bubbly around the sides. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley and enjoy!
