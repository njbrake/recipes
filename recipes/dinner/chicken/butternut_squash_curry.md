## Ingredients

- 2 lbs. butternut squash (about 4 cups diced)
- 1 yellow onion
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 Tbsp grated fresh ginger
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 Tbsp curry powder
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 15oz. can fire roasted diced tomatoes
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 13.5oz can full-fat coconut milk
- 2 oz. fresh spinach
- 1/2 tsp salt (or to taste)

## Instructions

1. Peel and dice the butternut squash into ½-inch pieces. Dice the onion, mince the garlic, and grate the ginger.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium. Add the olive oil, onion, garlic, and ginger, and sauté for a few minutes, or until the onions are translucent. Add the curry powder and cumin and sauté for one minute more.
3. Add the diced tomatoes and water to the skillet. Stir and dissolve any browned bits off the bottom of the skillet.
