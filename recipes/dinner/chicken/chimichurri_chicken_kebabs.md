## Ingredients

- 1 cup Italian parsley, packed
- 1/2 cup cilantro, packed
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp cumin
- 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 boneless, skinless chicken breast (3/4 to 1 lb.)
- 1 bell pepper
- 1 zucchini
- 1 red onion
- 8 oz button mushrooms
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 pinch salt and pepper
- 4 cups cooked rice

## Instructions

1. If using wooden skewers, place them in a shallow dish and add an inch or two of water. Soak the skewers as you prepare the ingredients. This prevents them from burning and catching fire from the close, intense heat of the grill or broiler.
2. First prepare the chimichurri. Pull the parsley and cilantro leaves from their stems, then chop them finely. Mince the garlic.
3. Combine the chopped parsley, cilantro, garlic, olive oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, cumin, crushed red pepper, and salt in a bowl. Stir to combine.
4. Cut the chicken breast into 1-inch cubes. Count your chicken pieces so you'll kroughly how many you want to use per skewer later. Place the cubed chicken in a bowl and add two spoonfuls of the prepared chimichurri, saving the remaining chimichurri to drizzle on after cooking. Stir to coat the chicken in the chimichurri.
5. Dice the bell pepper, zucchini, mushrooms, and red onion into 1-
6. 5 inch pieces. Place the vegetables in a large bowl and add 2 Tbsp olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Toss the vegetables until they are well coated in oil.
7. Adjust your oven's rack so that the top of a baking sheet or broiler pan will be about 5 inches from the oven's broiler. Turn the broiler on to begin pre-heating.
8. Place two wire racks on a baking sheet, or use a broiler pan. Begin building your kebabs by adding chicken and vegetable pieces in random order. I had about 24 chicken pieces, so I used three pieces of chicken per skewer, adding random vegetables between.
9. Place your kebabs on the prepared baking sheet or broiler pan. place the pan under the broiler. Broil until the tops of the vegetables just begin to brown (about 8-10 minutes). Watch the kebabs closely, as broilers can cook food VERY QUICKLY. Remove the pan from the oven, carefully flip the kebabs and place back under the broiler. Broil until the second side begins to brown (about 4-5 minutes).
10. Serve the chimichurri chicken kebabs over a bed of rice with a spoonful or two of the remaining chimichurr drizzled over top.
