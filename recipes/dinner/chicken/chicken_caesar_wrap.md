- 1 Tbsp grated Parmesan

## Instructions

1. Cut the chicken breast into small ½-inch pieces. Place the chicken in a bowl and add 1 Tbsp olive oil, the Parmesan, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Toss until the chicken is evenly coated in oil and seasoning.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium. add an additional 1 Tbsp olive oil and swirl to coat. Add the seasoned chicken and cook until browned and cooked through (about 5 minutes). If needed, add a couple tablespoons of water to the skillet to loosen the chicken before flipping. Set the chicken aside to cool.
3. prepare the buttered breadcrumbs. Add the butter, panko breadcrumbs, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper to a small skillet. Cook over medium until everything is evenly mixed and the breadcrumbs are golden brown (about 3 minutes). Set the breadcrumbs aside to cool.
4. Wash, drain, and chop the Romaine lettuce. Slice the grape tomatoes in half. Add the lettuce, tomatoes, Parmesan cheese, cooled chicken, breadcrumbs, and Caesar dressing to a bowl. Toss until everything is evenly mixed.
5. Divide the salad mixture between 4 large flour tortillas. Fold and roll the tortillas up like a burrito (bottom first, fold in the sides, then continue to roll to the top). Use a toothpick to hold them closed, slice in half, then serve.
