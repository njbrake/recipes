## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/4 cup lemon juice
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 Tbsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp salt
- Freshly cracked pepper
- 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 1.8 lbs.)
- 1/2 cup plain Greek style yogurt
- 1/2 tsp dried dill
- 1 Tbsp lemon juice
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 pint grape tomatoes
- 1 cucumber
- 1/4 red onion
- 6 pieces flatbread
- 10 oz. container hummus

## Instructions

1. Prepare the garlic chicken marinade first. In a gallon-sized zip top bag or shallow dish combine the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper. Add the chicken thighs, close the top of the bag, and massage the ingredients to combine. Let the chicken marinate for 30 minutes.
2. While the chicken is marinating, prepare the dill yogurt sauce. In a small bowl combine the Greek yogurt, dried dill, lemon juice, and salt. Set the sauce aside
3. Slice the grape tomatoes in half, dice the cucumber, and thinly slice the red onion. Place the red onion in a bowl of ice water and let it soak for 5-10 minutes to take the sharp edge off the flavor.
4. After the chicken has marinated for 30 minutes, cook the chicken thighs in a skillet over medium heat for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until well browned and cooked through. Cook the chicken in two batches to prevent over crowding the skillet, which will prevent browning. Transfer the cooked chicken to a cutting board to rest for 5 minutes before slicing.
5. To build the wraps, smear each flat bread with a couple tablespoons of hummus, pile some sliced chicken on top, then top with a handful of tomatoes, cucumbers, and a few slices of onion. Add a few dollops of the dill yogurt sauce, wrap the bread around the filling, and enjoy!
