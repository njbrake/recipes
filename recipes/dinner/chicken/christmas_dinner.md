## Instructions

1. **Preheat** the oven to 350 °F
2. **Prepare the chicken:** Pat dry, rub with olive oil, salt & pepper.
3. Mix lemon zest, juice, garlic, rosemary & thyme; stuff half the mixture plus a lemon wedge into the cavity. Rub the other half onto the outside of the chicken.
4. **Roast** chicken in roasting pan, 25 min per 1 lb of chicken
5. **Rest** the chicken for 10 min, tented loosely with foil. While resting, make a quick pan sauce: add ½ cup stock or wine to the pan, scrape browned bits, reduce by half, whisk in 1 Tbsp cold butter, season.
6. **Roast potatoes & carrots:** Toss with olive oil, rosemary, paprika, salt & pepper; spread on a baking sheet. Roast 35–40 min, turning halfway, until golden and tender.
7. **Steam green beans:** Steam 4–5 min until bright green. In a pan, melt butter, add garlic until fragrant (≈30 s), toss beans in, season with salt & pepper.
8. **Make salad:** Combine arugula, Parmesan & pine nuts in a bowl. Whisk olive oil, vinegar, salt & pepper; drizzle over salad just before serving.
9. **Carve** the rested chicken, arrange on a platter with roasted potatoes, carrots & green beans. Drizzle pan sauce over the chicken and serve alongside the salad.
10. **Dessert (optional):** Melt chocolate over a double boiler, let cool slightly. Whisk egg yolks with sugar (if using), fold into chocolate. Fold in beaten egg whites, then whisked cream. Divide into two glasses and chill 30–60 min before serving.
