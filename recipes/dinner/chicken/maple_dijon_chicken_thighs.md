## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup Dijon mustard
- 2 Tbsp real maple syrup
- 1 Tbsp olive oil
- 2 tsp soy sauce
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1/2 Tbsp dried rosemary (or fresh, chopped)
- 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375ÂºF. In a small bowl, stir together the Dijon mustard, maple syrup, olive oil, and soy sauce. Mince the garlic and chop the rosemary. Stir both into the marinade.

2. Arrange the chicken thighs in a baking dish so that they are close, but not overlapping. Pour the marinade on top and then spread it around until the thighs are completely covered.

3. Bake the chicken thighs in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes, or until they are cooked through and the liquid around the thighs is simmering. Spoon some of the liquid over the thighs, return them to the oven, then switch the oven's setting from bake to broil. Broil for about 5 minutes, or until the top of the chicken is golden brown. Watch the chicken closely as it broils, as broilers can vary.
