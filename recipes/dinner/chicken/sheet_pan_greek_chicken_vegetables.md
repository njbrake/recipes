## Ingredients

### Lemon Garlic Marinade
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1 fresh lemon
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 Tbsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp salt
- Freshly cracked pepper

### Chicken and Vegetables
- 1 pint grape tomatoes
- 2 bell peppers
- 1 small red onion
- 1.5 lbs. boneless skinless chicken breast

### Toppings
- 15 kalamata olives (about 1/2 cup)
- 2 oz. crumbled feta
- handful fresh parsley

### For Serving (optional)
- 4 cups cooked rice

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Zest the lemon, then squeeze the juice. Combine the olive oil, lemon juice (about 1/4 cup), garlic, oregano, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper in a bowl. Save the lemon zest for later.
1. Chop the bell peppers and onions into 1-in pieces. Place the tomatoes, bell peppers, and onions on a large baking sheet. Pour about half of the lemon garlic marinade over the vegetables and toss until they are well coated. Roast the vegetables in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes as you prepare the chicken.
1. Cut each chicken breast into two pieces. Place the chicken in a shallow dish and pour the remaining marinade over top. Toss the chicken in the marinade to coat.
1. After roasting for ten minutes, remove the baking sheet with the vegetables from the oven. Stir the vegetables well, then push them off to each side making room for the chicken in the center. Place the chicken pieces on the baking sheet.
1. Return the baking sheet to the oven and bake the chicken and vegetables for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165ºF. Switch the oven to broil and finish by broiling the chicken and vegetables for about 5 minutes.
1. Slice the olives in half. Sprinkle the olives, feta, lemon zest, and parsley over the chicken and vegetables after roasting, then serve.
