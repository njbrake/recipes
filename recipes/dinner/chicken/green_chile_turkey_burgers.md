## Ingredients

- 19 oz. pkg ground turkey
- 4 oz. can diced green chiles (drained, $0.69)
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 2-3 green onions (sliced, $0.13)
- 2 oz pepper jack cheese (shredded, $0.61)
- 5 hamburger buns
- 1 large tomato (optional, $0.95)
- 1 large avocado (optional, $1.50)

## Instructions

1. Place the ground turkey, green chiles (drained), sliced green onions, shredded pepper jack, cumin, garlic powder, and salt in a large bowl. Mix the ingredients until well combined. Divide and shape the mixture into five patties. The mixture will be fairly wet.
2. Cook the burgers in a skillet, on a grill, or using an indoor grill like a George Foreman, until they are cooked through (internal temperature of 165ÂºF) and well browned on the outside. Cooking time will depend on the method, size, and thickness of your patties.
3. Serve each patty on a bun with a slice of tomato, a couple slices of avocado, and a smear of mayonnaise.
