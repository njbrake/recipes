## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup plain yogurt
- 1 Tbsp lemon juice
- 1 Tbsp garlic (minced, $0.04)
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1/4 tsp ground cloves
- 2 large chicken breasts (1.25 lbs, $2.67)
- 7 oz plain greek yogurt
- 1/4 tsp garlic (minced, $0.02)
- 1/4 tsp dried dill
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/2 head romaine lettuce
- 1 medium cucumber
- 2 medium roma tomatoes
- 1/4 red onion (optional, $0.27*)
- 4 homemade naan (pita or flatbread, $0.64**)

## Instructions

1. Mix the ingredients for the marinade (yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, cinnamon, oregano, salt, nutmeg, and clove). Add chicken to the marinade, coat well, cover and refrigerate for 4-24 hours. If desired, slice the chicken into strips before marinating to maximize the flavor.
2. Prepare the yogurt sauce for the sandwiches. Combine the plain Greek yogurt with the garlic, dill, and salt. Refrigerate until ready to use.
3. After marinating the chicken, grill until cooked through (I use an indoor tabletop grill; the total amount of time it'll take to cook will vary from grill to grill). Don't forget to flip your chicken over if your grill doesn't have a lid that cooks evenly from both sides (like a George Foreman grill).***
4. After it's grilled, let it sit for a few minutes to let the juices redistribute and then slice it into strips (if not already sliced).
5. Prepare the vegetables for the sandwich. Chop, rinse, and drain the lettuce in a colander. Wash and slice the cucumber and tomato. Slice the red onion.
6. Build the sandwiches. Spread the yogurt sauce on your flat bread, top with the chicken and vegetables. Roll the sandwich closed. You can wrap the sandwich in foil to help it stay closed as you eat.
