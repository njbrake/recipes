## Ingredients

- 8 Tbsp butter, room temperature
- 4 oz. cream cheese, room temperature
- 1 cup + 2 Tbsp all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp freshly cracked pepper
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/2 lb. frozen broccoli florets, thawed
- 4 oz. cheddar cheese, shredded

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Add the room temperature butter and room temperature cream cheese to a bowl. Use a mixer to whip them together until evenly combined.
2. Begin stirring in the flour, about ¼ cup at a time, until a dough forms. The dough should be soft, but not sticky.
3. Divide the dough into 12 equal portions (begin by dividing into four pieces, then divide each quarter into three equal-sized pieces). Roll each piece of dough into a ball, then drop each one into the well of a muffin tin. Use your fingers to press the dough down into the center and up the sides of the wells (see step by step photos below for more help).
4. Whisk together the eggs, milk, Parmesan, garlic powder, pepper, and salt in a bowl.
5. Finely chop the thawed broccoli florets (about
6. 5 cups once chopped). Shred the cheddar cheese (about 1 cup shredded). Add the broccoli and cheddar to the egg mixture and stir to combine.
7. Divide the broccoli cheddar mixture between the twelve mini pie crusts. The liquid egg mixture will not fully submerge the broccoli and cheddar in the crusts, but it will puff up and fill the crust once baked.
8. Bake the mini quiches in the preheated oven for 35 minutes or until puffed in the center and golden brown around the edges.
9. Carefully transfer the baked quiches to a wire rack to cool. Serve warm, or at room temperature within two hours of baking.
