# Waffle Recipe

## Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 3/4 cups milk
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil or melted butter
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.
2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then add the milk, oil, and vanilla. Mix well.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Don't overmix.
4. Let the batter rest for about 5 minutes while you preheat your waffle iron.
5. Cook according to your waffle iron's instructions.

This recipe typically yields about 4-6 waffles, depending on your waffle iron's size.

For extra crispy waffles, you can try substituting 1/4 cup of the milk with club soda.
