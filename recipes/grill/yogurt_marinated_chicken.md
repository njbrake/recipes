## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup plain yogurt
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 Tbsp lemon juice
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1/4 tsp ground cloves
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1.3 lbs.)*
- 1 Tbsp cooking oil

## Instructions

1. Combine the yogurt, minced garlic, lemon juice, cinnamon, oregano, salt, nutmeg, and cloves in a bowl.
2. Slice the chicken breasts into two thinner pieces so they cook quickly and evenly in the skillet. If slicing is too difficult, you can cover the chicken breasts with plastic and use a rolling pin or mallet to pound the chicken into an even thickness (1/2-3/4 inch thick), then slice the breast across into two smaller portions.
3. Place the chicken in a shallow dish or zip-top bag and pour the yogurt marinade over top. Make sure all sides of the chicken are coated in yogurt, then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours.
4. When you're ready to cook, heat Â½ Tbsp cooking oil in a large skillet (preferably some sort of non-stick surface) over medium heat. add two pieces of chicken and cook on each side until deeply browned. Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean cutting board and repeat with the rest of the cooking oil and second two pieces of chicken.
5. Let the chicken rest for five minutes, then slice and serve!
