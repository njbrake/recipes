## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 2 Tbsp red wine vinegar
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp dried basil, divided
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/8 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
- 1.3 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken breast
- 1/2 cup chicken broth
- 2 Tbsp tomato paste
- 1/4 tsp sugar

## Instructions

1. Mix the olive oil, red wine vinegar, minced garlic, ½ tsp dried basil, salt, and pepper.
2. Use a sharp knife to fillet the chicken breasts into two thinner pieces each.
3. Place the chicken breast pieces in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over top. Flip the chicken a couple of times to make sure all surfaces are coated. Marinate the chicken for 30 minutes, or up to one day (refrigerated), flipping once or twice throughout.
4. Heat a large skillet over medium. transfer the chicken pieces to the skillet. There should be enough oil from the marinade to prevent sticking. Cook the chicken for about five minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through, then remove it to a clean plate.
5. Add the tomato paste, chicken broth, the remaining ½ tsp dried basil, and sugar to the skillet. Use a whisk to combine the ingredients and dissolve any browned bits off the bottom of the skillet.
6. Let the sauce simmer over medium-low heat for about five minutes, or until slightly thickened. Return the chicken to the skillet and spoon the sauce over top. Serve and enjoy.
