title: Cheese Enchiladas
---

## Ingredients

- 12 small corn tortillas
- 12 oz. cheese, shredded
- 1 4oz. can diced green chiles (drained)
- 1/4 cup sour cream
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp ground cumin
- 1/8 tsp salt
- 1.5 cups enchilada sauce

## Instructions

1. Toast the tortillas in a hot skillet, one at a time for a few seconds on each side, or just until lightly browned.
2. Add ¾ of the shredded cheese to a bowl (saving the remainder to top the enchiladas). Also add the drained green chiles, sour cream, garlic powder, cumin, and salt. Stir the ingredients to combine.
3. Preheat oven to 350°F. Add about ½ cup of enchilada sauce to the bottom of a large casserole dish and spread it around until it covers the surface.
4. Fill each tortilla with about 3 Tbsp of the cheese filling, then roll to close, and place them in the casserole dish. Continue until all of the tortillas have been filled, rolled, and placed in the dish.
5. Pour the remaining 1 cup of enchilada sauce over the enchiladas, then top with the remaining shredded cheese.
6. Bake the enchiladas for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or just until they are heated through and melty. Do not overbake the enchiladas, as this can cause the filling to separate and curdle. Serve hot with your favorite toppings* and sides!
