## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp cooking oil (*, $0.10)
- 2 Tbsp all-purpose flour
- 2 Tbsp chili powder (**, $0.60)
- 2 cups water
- 3 oz. tomato paste (1/2 of a 6oz can, $0.23)
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
- 2 tsp unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 15oz. can black beans
- 1 avocado
- 1 tomato
- 2 green onions
- 1 cup frozen corn kernels
- 1 handful fresh cilantro
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 10 8-inch tortillas (*** $2.49)

## Instructions

1. First prepare the enchilada sauce. In a medium sauce pot combine the cooking oil, flour, and chili powder. Heat the mixture over a medium flame until it begins to bubble. Whisk and cook the bubbling paste for 1-2 minutes. Slowly pour in the water while whisking. Add the tomato paste, cumin, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, cocoa powder, and salt. Whisk until smooth and continue to heat over a medium flame. Let the sauce come up to a gentle simmer, at which point the sauce will thicken. turn off the heat and set the sauce aside.
2. Preheat oven to 350°F. Drain and rinse the can of beans, then add them to a large bowl. Cube the avocado, dice the tomato, slice the green onion, and pull a handful of cilantro leaves from their stems. Add them all to the bowl, along with the frozen corn kernels. Stir everything together. Season with a little salt and garlic powder.
3. Coat a casserole dish with non-stick spray. Fill each tortilla with about 1/3 cup of filling and roll tightly. Place the filled tortillas in the casserole dish, seam side down. pour the enchilada sauce over top.
4. Bake the enchiladas in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until they’re heated through and the sauce is bubbly along the edges. Top with any remaining cilantro and enjoy!
